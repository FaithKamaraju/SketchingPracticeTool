# Random Form Generator for Sketching Practice

I just built this quick app to help me practice some shapes and form sketching.

# Refactoring my code -

I realized the whole react part of my app was a bit pointless. lol

BUT, I'm not done with RTF yet. I'm gonna still use react and threejs together but this time, I might just do all the controls using Leva or dat.gui

Now the roadmap for refactoring of the code -

- [x] Base Mesh wrapper around the rtf components
- [ ] ~~dat.gui or leva panels for~~ tweakpane panels
  - [x] Dropdown for mesh geometry selector
  - [ ] Dropdown for mesh material selector
  - [x] Grid
  - [x] Axes
  - [x] Directional Light
  - [x] Ambient Light
  - [x] Mesh transform panel
  - [x] Mesh color panel
- [ ] Sketchfab integration
- [ ] Url download for any other service for free opensource models

~~Roadmap and planned features for this small app -~~

~~- [x] All the basic primitives in three.js~~
~~- [x] Mesh selector dropdown implemented~~
~~- [x] Camera controls to reposition the form as the user likes~~
~~- [x] Background envs and a perspective grid~~
~~- [x] Ambient Light checkbox~~
~~- [x] Grid checkbox~~
~~- [x] Axis checkbox~~
~~- [x] Directional Light with LEVA controls for its transform.~~
~~- [x] Directional Light checkbox -- But Will Probably Refactor this --~~
~~- [ ] Model Transform Controls with LEVA~~
~~- [ ] Model color picker~~
~~- [ ] Model scaling~~
~~- [ ] GLTF loader?~~
~~- [ ] Material Type Dropdown~~
~~- [ ] Add More materials~~
~~- [ ] Randomizer that generates forms in different angles and different lighting~~
~~- [ ] Add Point Lights with transform controls~~

~~Maybe Features -~~

~~- [ ] Handling maybe complex meshes~~
~~- [ ] Uploading custom models?~~
~~- [ ] SKETCHFAB INTEGRATION --- Mostly Yes ---~~
~~- [ ] Add more lights~~
~~- [ ] Multiple Models~~

~~Refactor TO-DO -~~

~~- [ ] Refactor the Meshes to use composition~~
~~- [ ] Refactor the control panel to have more componentized controls~~
